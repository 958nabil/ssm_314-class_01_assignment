		<h1> Hello! This is <span> Maruf Hossain </span></h1>

		<p> <span> Hi </span>, my name is Maruf Hossain. I am the student of inter 2nd year of Dhaka Udayan Govt. College. I have 1 brother and 5 sisters and I am a small boy in my family. We are living in Dhaka. My big brother is working as a shop manager at <b> Jamuna Future Park </b> and he is a student of Honours 4th in Mohammadpur Central University College.

		<i> 2020 is a terrible year for us. Because this year has taken a heavy toll on our lives. Our educational institution has been closed since last March which made my study condition very bad. </i> So I wondered if this opportunity could be used to acquire any knowledge outside of education. With that in mind, I sat at home for a while and did some online search. I can acquire skills on any subject through computer. After much deliberation, I finally decided to learn <b> Web Development </b>. For which I will need a good organization or a skilled trainer. Then I look online to find an organization whose name <b> Shikhbe Shobai </b> and since then I have been watching their activities on their <b> Facebook page</b>. After following their Facebook page for a long time, I found that their activities are very good and I decided that I can also join this organization to improve my skills in Web Development work. And finally on <b> 12-12-2020 </b> I was admitted to this institution.

		The only goal now is for me to learn how to work well and become a <b> skilled Freelancer </b>through this work and I can reach my destination.
